Welcome to LidlPaint, a simple Java program that allows you to unleash your creativity by painting on a grid board.
With features like painting, saving, erasing, and loading saved projects, LidlPaint is designed to be a user-friendly and fun application for creating simple pixel art.

## How To Play:

1. ArrowKeys to move through the canvas;
2. SpaceBar + arrowkey will paint that square and so on;
3. S will save your progress;
4. C key will clean the entire canvas;
5. L will load your saved progress;

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to a local repo and run it in your favorite IDE(I recomment Intelli J bacause the program is in Java);

Enjoy!
